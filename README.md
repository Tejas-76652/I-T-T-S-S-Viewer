# Multilingual OCR, Translation, and Summarization Tool
This project is a comprehensive tool designed for text extraction, translation, and summarization across multiple languages. The tool uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract text from various file formats such as images (PNG, JPG) and PDFs. Once the text is extracted, users can translate it into multiple languages or generate concise summaries of the content. The project leverages advanced libraries like pytesseract for OCR, googletrans for translation, and transformers for text summarization.

Key features include:

* OCR: Supports text extraction from images and PDFs in multiple languages.
* Translation: Translates extracted text into numerous languages using Google Translate.
* Summarization: Summarizes long texts into concise, readable summaries using advanced transformer-based models.
* User Interface: A simple and interactive Tkinter-based GUI allows users to upload files, translate, and summarize text seamlessly.
* This tool is ideal for users working with multilingual documents, providing a unified platform for text processing.
